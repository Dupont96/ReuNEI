    '''
    A table of the cooling rate coefficient Lambda(T) provided by John
    Raymond for the following abundance set:
    
    Abundance set:
    He    C    N    O    Ne   Mg   Si   S    Ar   Ca   Fe   Ni 
    10.93 8.82 7.96 8.52 7.96 7.52 7.60 7.20 6.90 6.30 7.60 6.30
    
    Multiply this by n_e * n_H to get cooling ergs*cm^3/s.  This includes
    lines & recombination, hydrogen, and bremsstrahlung.
    
    Note that this cooling curve assumes ionization equilibrium so there
    may be errors that arise when the plasma is far from ionization
    equilibrium!
    
    ***Need to double check units!  Is cooling in ergs?***
